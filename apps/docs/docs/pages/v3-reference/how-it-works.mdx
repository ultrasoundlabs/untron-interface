# How V3 Works

This page explains the core ideas behind V3 at a high level: the nouns you’ll see in the API, how they relate, and how to reason about system state.

## Mental model

Think in terms of:

- **intent-like actions** (what the user wants)
- **deterministic settlement** (what the system guarantees)
- **observability** (what you can prove from data)

## Core entities

- **Lease:** a long-lived “session” that groups activity and state over time.
- **Claim:** a unit of work/value that is created, tracked, and eventually settled (or expires).
- **Controller / executor:** the system components responsible for progressing state and performing execution.
- **Deposits / fills:** events and balances that connect external payment rails to on-chain or protocol settlement.

The exact shapes of these objects are defined by the API schema; the goal of this section is to help you understand how they fit together.

## Lifecycle (conceptual)

At a high level, flows look like:

- **Create:** a lease (and/or claim) is created.
- **Attribute:** deposits and other inputs are linked to protocol state.
- **Execute:** controllers/executors progress state and perform the required actions.
- **Settle:** outcomes are finalized and made observable via the API.
- **Expire / recover:** timeouts and recovery paths handle incomplete flows.

## Observability

For integrations and analytics, treat the API as the source of truth for the protocol’s current view of state, and prefer querying views/endpoints designed for aggregation (rather than reconstructing state from raw events).
