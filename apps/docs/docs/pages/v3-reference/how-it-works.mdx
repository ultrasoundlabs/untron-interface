# How V3 Works

Untron V3 converts **provable Tron deposits** into **settleable EVM payouts**.

## The 30-second picture

1. A depositor sends TRC-20 USDT on Tron to a **deterministic receiver address** (derived from a `receiverSalt`).
2. On the EVM hub, a **lease** defines *who* controls routing for that salt (beneficiary/target chain/token/fees) at a given time.
3. The hub recognizes value and creates **claims** (always denominated in hub USDT).
4. Anyone can settle claims permissionlessly via **`fill`** (optionally swapping/bridging) to the lease’s payout config.

## Recognition paths

There are two ways deposits/controller activity become claims:

- **Fast path:** prove an individual Tron deposit directly on the hub (`preEntitle`).
- **Slow path:** relay + process the Tron controller’s SHA-256 event hash-chain (`relayControllerEventChain`, `processControllerEvents`).

## Key nouns

- **Receiver salt:** stable identifier; receiver contracts can be deployed “late”.
- **Lease:** time-indexed routing authority + fee parameters.
- **Claim:** hub-side obligation enqueued for later settlement.
