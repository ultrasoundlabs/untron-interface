# V3 Reference

This section is for people who want to understand **how Untron V3 works**, not just how to call an endpoint.

Untron V3 is a two-lane protocol:

- **Tron collection lane:** deposits of (typically) TRC-20 USDT into deterministic receiver addresses.
- **EVM settlement hub:** routing authority over time (**leases**), accounting/recognition, **claims**, and permissionless settlement (**fill**).
