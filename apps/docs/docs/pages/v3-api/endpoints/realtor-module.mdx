# Realtor endpoints

The **Realtor module** is the “active” part of the V3 API — the endpoints you call to **manage leases**.

Unlike most V3 endpoints (which are PostgREST views over the indexer DB), these endpoints behave more like an application API:

- They create/update protocol state (via relayed / gasless operations).
- They return tracking identifiers (e.g. `userop_hash`) and computed addresses.
- They are the endpoints most likely to have product-level semantics (and therefore the ones we prioritize in docs).

## Core endpoints

- `GET /realtor` – fetch realtor terms, limits, and supported pairs.
- `POST /realtor` – create a lease (returns receiver addresses + `userop_hash`).
- `POST /payout_config` – update payout configuration (gasless relay; returns `userop_hash`).
- `GET /leases/{lease_id}` – fetch the aggregated lease view for a single lease id.

## Typical flow

1. Call `GET /realtor` to confirm you’re allowed and to read terms.
2. Call `POST /realtor` to create a lease and get receiver addresses.
3. Watch the lease/indexer state via `GET /leases/{lease_id}` (and/or indexer views).
4. Update payout config via `POST /payout_config` when needed.
