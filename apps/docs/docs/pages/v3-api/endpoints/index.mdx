# V3 API Endpoints

These pages are intentionally “docs-first”: we explain what to query, how filtering works, and what to expect back.

Use the **Try it** panel on each endpoint to open Scalar’s API Client modal.

## Query style (high level)

Many V3 endpoints behave like database views:

- most endpoints are `GET` and return arrays
- you can filter via query params (and some endpoints support `select`, `order`, `limit`, `offset`)

When in doubt, open the endpoint in the client and let it generate a working request.

## Realtor endpoints
