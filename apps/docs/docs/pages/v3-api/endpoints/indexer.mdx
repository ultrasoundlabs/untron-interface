# Indexer endpoints

Most V3 endpoints are **PostgREST-style views** over the indexer database. They’re powerful for analytics and dashboards, but they’re not as “product-stable” as the Bridge API.

## What to expect

- Most endpoints are `GET` and return **arrays**.
- Filtering is done via query parameters.
- Many endpoints support common PostgREST-style params like `select`, `order`, `limit`, `offset` (and headers like `Range`).

## Where to start

- Aggregated lease state: [GET /lease_view](/v3-api/endpoints/lease-view)
- Raw hub registry: [GET /hub_leases](/v3-api/endpoints/hub-leases)
- USDT deposit timeline: [GET /usdt_deposit_txs](/v3-api/endpoints/usdt-deposit-txs)

## Full coverage

We also ship auto-generated pages for every endpoint, linked in the sidebar under **Indexer endpoints → All endpoints**:
