# Bridge API

Untron Bridge API is the boring part, done right: a **stable** interface for swapping and bridging stablecoins across chains and ecosystems — even as the underlying protocols, routers, and token standards keep changing.

If you’ve ever shipped with USDT variants, CCTP, chain quirks, or “one-off” bridges, you already know the pattern:

- Integrations break at the worst time.
- Small differences in token behavior become big production incidents.
- APIs drift, naming changes, semantics change — your code becomes a museum of exceptions.

The Bridge API is our answer: a **trusted, intent-style API** (NEAR Intents vibes) that lets you build stablecoin experiences without tracking every implementation detail.

:::tip[Think of it like…]
**Stripe for stablecoins**: you integrate once, Untron absorbs the churn.

## What you get

::::steps
### Stable surface area

Endpoints and semantics are designed to remain stable over time.

### Protocol-powered execution

Behind the scenes, routing can use Untron V3, Untron Intents, and other mechanisms as they evolve.

### Stablecoin hygiene

Convenient wrappers over messy realities (e.g. CCTP flows, USDT variants like USDT0), so your app can stay clean.

## Who should use this

- Apps that want a single integration for “send / swap / bridge stablecoins”
- Teams optimizing for reliability and long-term maintenance
- Anyone who’d rather not become an expert in every new stablecoin rail
