        <h3>What this page covers</h3>
        <p>
          This notice explains how data is handled on the marketing site at untron.finance. Bridge
          transactions occur on public blockchains and are not private by default.
        </p>

        <h3>Data we collect</h3>
        <p>
          We may process basic site interaction data (for example page views, language selection,
          and CTA clicks) to improve product UX and performance.
        </p>

        <h3>Local storage</h3>
        <p>
          This site stores your theme preference in browser localStorage under the key
          <code>theme</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>Third-party services</h3>
        <p>
          External links (docs, social platforms, wallet/exchange providers) have their own privacy
          practices. Review their policies separately.
        </p>

        <h3>Your choices</h3>
        <p>
          You can clear localStorage in your browser and avoid connecting wallets if you do not want
          wallet-linked behavior.
        </p>

        <h3>Contact</h3>
        <p>
          Privacy questions can be sent to
          <a class="text-link" href={t.links.contactEmail}> contact@untron.finance</a>.
